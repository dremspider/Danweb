Project 1

Danweb

to make danweb, use the commands:
make danweb

All folders passed into the command line and the configuration file must have a trailing slash at the end, otherwise it will fail.

The module for testing purposes is hello.o. To make this program, run the command "make hello".

The attackcmd.sh program is a simple shell script to verify the input handling at the command line

The attackweb.sh is a python script to verify that it can work with bad input across the web.  I also used apache bench to test the application
